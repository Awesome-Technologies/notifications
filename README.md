# Notifications

This app provides a backend and frontend for the notification API available in [Nextcloud](https://github.com/nextcloud/server/).
The API is used by other apps to notify users in the web UI and sync clients about various things. Some examples are:

* ðŸ“¬ [Federated file sharing](https://github.com/nextcloud/server/tree/master/apps/federatedfilesharing): You received a new remote shares
* ðŸ“‘ [Comments](https://github.com/nextcloud/server/tree/master/apps/federatedfilesharing): Another user mentioned you in a comment on a file
* ðŸš¢ [Update notification](https://github.com/nextcloud/server/tree/master/apps/updatenotification): Available update for an app or nextcloud itself
* ðŸ“£ [Announcement center](https://github.com/nextcloud/announcementcenter): An announcement was posted by an admin
